http protocol course - understanding the protocol

http - hyper text transfer protocol

methods:

get - retrieves data from server
post - submit data to the server
put - update data of the server
delete - delete data from the server

body:
	in the body we have important data of the request, request and response has the body

	the body can be data that comes from server (json, html code, css code, etc)

	and the body can be data we are sending on request, for example, when we are sending
	some data form, the fields of this forms will be part of the request body

headers:
	in general way a request is builded like this:

		METHOD PATH PROTOCOL
		get products/eletronics/keyboards http 1.0

	headers specify configuration, we have this division

	general - url, method, status code, remote address (ip of computer wich is making request or recieving)
	request - server(it is hidden for security in the most part of the times), set-cookie (have to study about cookies), content-type*, content-length, date.
	response - cookies, accept-xxx (it has something with cors), content-type *, authorization, user-agent, referrer

	* content-type -> in generics i think this could be the same for both of them, when we are using ajax we have a small difference between data-type and content-type; in this case, content-type will be the data we are sending to the server, and data-type will be that one wich we are waiting for.

http status code:

1xx - information -> request recieved, we are processing this data to make a response
2xx - success -> request recieved, understood and accepted
3xx - redirect -> futher action that will be taken/redirected
4xx - client error -> server didn't recieved enough information from client, for example, there is something missing on request.
5xx - server error -> we have enough data but something went wrong in the server-side

use this website to work with http codes, u don't need to remember all of then https://http.cat
